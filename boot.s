    The multiboot standard does not define the value of the stack pointer register (esp)
    and it is up to the kernel to provide a stack. This allocates room for a small stack
    by creating a symbol at the bottom of it, the allocating 16384 bytes for it, and finally 
    creating a symbol at the top. The stack grows downwards on x86. The stack is in its own
    section so it can be marked nobits, which means the kernel file is smaller because it 
    does not contain an uninitialized stack. The stack on x86 must be 16-byte aligned
    according to the System V ABI standard and de-facto extensions. The compiler will assume
    the stack is properly aligned and failure to align the stack results in undefined behavoir.
